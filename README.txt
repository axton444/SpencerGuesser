SPENCERGUESSER is a Markov model-based password guesser written in C.
It generates password candidates according to their occurrence probabilities, i.e., 
it outputs most likely passwords first. OMEN significantly improves 
guessing speed over existing proposals.

details on how SPENCERGUESSER improves on existing Markov 
model-based password guessing approaches,
